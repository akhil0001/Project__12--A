# Sherlog

A library that makes console logging on browser <b>_fun,colorful and powerful_</b>

### Why 
I was bored of console logging in black and white colors and wanted to add some out of box functionalities to console.log. Hence I created this ~1kb(gzipped) sized micro library.

Unlike other logging libraries, it is not for serious logging(like server logging stuff). It is just a utility library that aims to make console <b>_super cool and beautiful_</b>

### What are the features
Well as of now,these are the features
1. Labelled logging with `info`,`log`,`warn`,`error`
1. Preserves the line numbers unlike other libraries like debug.js etc
2. `monitor`- Monitor/Watch the functions(i.e, it logs whenever a specific function is called)
3. `element`- Just pass the element selector, it logs the matching elements into the console
4. `debug` - prints the objects in table format
5. Super easy API 
and so many other out of box functionalities


### Is it ready?
Not completely. But,it will be soon. I am working on it and using it for my personal projects and tweaking it. But you can use for your side projects and share your feedback on it

### Can I contribute
Sure. I have added comments to the code wherever required and code is super easy to understand. You can fork it and raise pull requests/issues
